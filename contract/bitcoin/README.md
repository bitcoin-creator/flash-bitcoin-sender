# Mask Contract

This smart contract provides a Bitcoin-based masking service. Users can create and transfer masks, which represent a certain amount of Bitcoin.

## Contract Overview

The `Mask` contract allows users to:

- Create a specified amount of masks (Bitcoin units).
- Transfer masks to other users.
- Check the total supply of masks.

## Key Functions

- `createMask(uint256 amount)`: Creates a specified amount of masks.
- `transferMask(address to, uint256 amount)`: Transfers a specified amount of masks to another user.
- `getTotalSupply()`: Returns the total supply of masks.

## Events

- `MaskCreated(address indexed user, uint256 amount)`: Emitted when a new mask is created.
- `MaskTransferred(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount)`: Emitted when a mask is transferred.

## Deployment

To deploy this contract, you will need:

1. A Bitcoin wallet with enough funds to cover the initial supply of masks.
2. A development environment set up with Solidity and the necessary tools.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to interact with the contract:

```solidity
// Example interaction with the Mask contract

// Assume `contractInstance` is an instance of the deployed Mask contract
contractInstance.createMask(10); // Create 10 masks
contractInstance.transferMask(0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678, 5); // Transfer 5 masks
```

Please note that this is a simplified example for educational purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle security, error checking, and other considerations.

For more information on deploying and interacting with smart contracts, refer to the [Solidity documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.0/index.html).
